\fs36 Questions:  \
\
#1  When setting up a new Organization, we will be using a separate SMS number for each organization?   \
\
#2  What number are we using for testing?\
\
#3   And, do we set up the same Voice and Messaging script as we do for schoolbeacon or will there be new setup scripts other than \

Link should be "\ul List Orgs\ulnone " instead of "\ul List Schools\ulnone "  \

(Note: This is in the Control Panel under the Sponsor Tab.\

I do not understand the login page. You can a) login with Facebook, or Sign In with your own user account.  But, when you "Register a New Account" There is no opportunity to create the new account with Facebook.   How do I register a new account with my Facebook account?\
\
***********  And Facebook Login routine is confusing *****************************************\
\
With Facebook, I followed this approach:\
\
\

\
First, I went to the my.beaconnow.com registration page.  Here it is confusing because I would normally go to the "Register New Account" Page instead of Login with the Facebook button or the or "Sign In" Button.   But, in order to try Facebook, I clicked on the Facebook Log In Button.\

\
And there was presented with the Facebook login, which I completed.\

\
But, was taken back right to this screen, so I guess I needed next to Register a new account.  I clicked on that but could not complete registration (see note below) so I could not test any further.\

When I want to create a new account, I am presented with all of the communities and all of the groups in the "David Test Community."  I set up to organizations -  (1) Men's Choir Club and (2) Girl's Choir Club and then specified their Community as "David Test Community."  But, when someone sets up a new account, they should not be shown all of the Communities and Organizations, they should be able to pick their community first.   Is that simply an interface issue you want to put in last after we get the functionality working ok?  If so, we can defer to later, but I think that a new registration process should include picking the Community First and then being directed to a page to select the Organizations in that Community. Do you agree?\

\
I tried to add in my registration with the Men's Choir Group, but received the error message above "You have to select at least one group to receive messages."   You can see that I have selected the Men's Choir Group.\

\
\
This also happens when I select both Organizations. So, I cannot register and test any further.\
